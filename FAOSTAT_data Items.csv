The threshold to classify ""moderate or severe"" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item ""having to eat less"" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low quality diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources.
